    <h1>Egg source</h1>
    <p>This one is going to be easy. If you are new to making Nigerian foods and desires to start with the recipes that are easy, I would suggest you start here. This takes just about six different ingredients and the preparation time is less than 20 minutes.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>2 spoons sliced pepper</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil (200ml).</li>
        <li>2 cups of sliced fresh tomatoes.</li>
        <li>Sliced pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>1 cup of sliced onions.</li>
        <li>One cube of maggi or knorr.</li>
        <li>Salt to taste.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by Slicing your tomatoes, onions, and peppers using a kitchen knife.</li>
        <li>Set frying pan on the heat and add just 200ml of oil (vegetable or olive oil), allow the oil to heat up for few minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the sliced tomatoes, peppers, onions and fry.</li>
        <li>Add salt to taste, half of a seasoning cube. Stir to avoid burning.</li>
        <li>Beat eggs in a separate bowl, add a pinch of salt and pour it into the frying tomatoes. </li>
        <li>Allow the egg to fry.</li>
        <li>Don't let it get burned. Try breaking into tiny crumbs so you can get an exact replica of what you see here.</li>
        <li>Serve egg sauce with boiled white yams.</li>

    </ol>
